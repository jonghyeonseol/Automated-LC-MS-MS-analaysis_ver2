# Solutions for n=3 Anchor Group Problem

**Date**: October 31, 2025
**Problem**: 4 prefix groups (GD1+HexNAc, GD1+dHex, GD3, GT1) have only 3 anchor compounds and severely overfit (validation R²≈0.10)

---

## 🎯 Problem Analysis

### Current Situation

| Group | Anchors | Training R² | Validation R² | Status |
|-------|---------|-------------|---------------|--------|
| GD1+HexNAc | 3 | 0.910 | 0.102 | ❌ REJECTED |
| GD1+dHex | 3 | 0.911 | 0.107 | ❌ REJECTED |
| GD3 | 3 | 0.910 | 0.101 | ❌ REJECTED |
| GT1 | 3 | 0.910 | 0.102 | ❌ REJECTED |

### Why n=3 Fails

**Mathematical Problem**:
```
Linear regression: RT = slope * Log P + intercept
- 2 parameters (slope, intercept)
- 3 data points
- Degrees of freedom = 3 - 2 = 1
- Model ALWAYS fits well (R² ≈ 0.90)
- But has ZERO generalization power (validation R² ≈ 0.10)
```

**Statistical Reality**:
- With 3 points, any random data can produce R² > 0.90
- Training R² is completely meaningless with n=3
- Validation R² reveals the truth: model has no predictive power
- This is overfitting in its purest form

### Impact

**Compounds Lost**:
- All compounds in GD1+HexNAc prefix group → cannot be analyzed
- All compounds in GD1+dHex prefix group → cannot be analyzed
- All compounds in GD3 prefix group → cannot be analyzed
- All compounds in GT1 prefix group → cannot be analyzed

**Estimated Loss**: 30-40% of test compounds (Anchor='F') may be in these groups.

## 💡 Solution Options

### Option A: Hierarchical Fallback (RECOMMENDED ⭐)

**Strategy**: Use prefix-specific regression when valid (n≥4, validation R²≥0.70), fall back to overall regression for n=3 groups.

**Implementation**:
```python
def _apply_rule1_with_fallback(self, df):
    valid_groups = []
    fallback_compounds = []

    for prefix in prefixes:
        anchor_count = len(anchor_compounds)

        if anchor_count >= 4:
            # Try prefix-specific regression
            validation_r2 = self._cross_validate_regression(X, y)

            if validation_r2 >= 0.70:
                # Use prefix-specific model (GOOD)
                valid_groups.append(prefix)
                apply_prefix_model(...)
            else:
                # Prefix model failed → fallback
                fallback_compounds.extend(prefix_group)

        elif anchor_count == 3:
            # Skip prefix-specific, use fallback directly
            fallback_compounds.extend(prefix_group)

        else:  # n < 3
            # Too few anchors, mark as invalid
            mark_as_outliers(...)

    # Apply overall regression to fallback compounds
    if fallback_compounds:
        apply_overall_regression(fallback_compounds, all_anchors)
```

**Advantages**:
- ✅ Uses best model when possible (prefix-specific for n≥4)
- ✅ Uses fallback for n=3 (better than nothing)
- ✅ Already partially implemented in code (lines 282-339)
- ✅ No additional data requirements
- ✅ Preserves good models (GD1, GM1)

**Disadvantages**:
- ⚠️ Overall model may be less accurate than prefix-specific
- ⚠️ Assumes RT-LogP relationship is similar across prefixes

**Expected Accuracy**: 10-15% improvement over current rejection approach

---

### Option B: Prefix Pooling Strategy

**Strategy**: Combine related prefix groups to increase sample size.

**Pooling Logic**:
```yaml
GD_family:
  - GD1 (23 anchors)
  - GD1+HexNAc (3 anchors)
  - GD1+dHex (3 anchors)
  - GD3 (3 anchors)
  Total: 32 anchors → EXCELLENT sample size

GT_family:
  - GT1 (3 anchors)
  - GT3 (if available)
  - Other GT variants
  Total: Depends on data
```

**Implementation**:
```python
prefix_families = {
    "GD": ["GD1", "GD1+HexNAc", "GD1+dHex", "GD3"],
    "GT": ["GT1", "GT3"],
    "GM": ["GM1", "GM3"],
}

def _pool_prefix_groups(self, df):
    for family_name, prefixes in prefix_families.items():
        family_anchors = df[
            df["prefix"].isin(prefixes) & (df["Anchor"] == "T")
        ]

        if len(family_anchors) >= 10:  # Sufficient for reliable regression
            # Fit family-level regression
            model = Ridge(alpha=1.0)
            model.fit(X, y)

            # Apply to all compounds in family
            for prefix in prefixes:
                apply_family_model_to_prefix(prefix, model)
```

**Advantages**:
- ✅ Increases sample size (3 → 10-30 anchors)
- ✅ Shares information across related compounds
- ✅ Validation R² will be realistic
- ✅ Chemically reasonable (similar structures have similar RT behavior)

**Disadvantages**:
- ⚠️ Assumes family members have similar RT-LogP relationships
- ⚠️ May lose prefix-specific nuances
- ⚠️ Requires defining family groupings
- ⚠️ More complex code

**Expected Accuracy**: 15-20% improvement if families are well-defined

---

### Option C: Adaptive Threshold for n=3

**Strategy**: Accept lower validation R² threshold for n=3 groups (e.g., 0.50 instead of 0.70).

**Implementation**:
```python
def _get_r2_threshold(self, n_samples):
    if n_samples >= 10:
        return 0.75  # Strict threshold for large samples
    elif n_samples >= 5:
        return 0.70  # Standard threshold
    elif n_samples >= 3:
        return 0.50  # Relaxed threshold for n=3
    else:
        return None  # Reject, too few samples
```

**Advantages**:
- ✅ Simple to implement (minimal code change)
- ✅ Allows n=3 groups to pass validation
- ✅ Acknowledges that small samples have lower validation R²

**Disadvantages**:
- ❌ Validation R²=0.10 is TERRIBLE even for n=3
- ❌ Would still reject current n=3 groups (validation R²=0.10 < 0.50)
- ❌ Doesn't solve the fundamental overfitting problem
- ❌ May accept bad models

**Expected Accuracy**: NOT RECOMMENDED - doesn't solve the actual problem

---

### Option D: Bayesian Ridge Regression

**Strategy**: Use Bayesian Ridge Regression which handles small samples better through probabilistic priors.

**Implementation**:
```python
from sklearn.linear_model import BayesianRidge

def _apply_bayesian_regression(self, df):
    model = BayesianRidge(
        alpha_1=1e-6,  # Gamma prior on alpha
        alpha_2=1e-6,  # Gamma prior on alpha
        lambda_1=1e-6, # Gamma prior on lambda
        lambda_2=1e-6, # Gamma prior on lambda
        compute_score=True
    )

    model.fit(X, y)

    # Bayesian model provides uncertainty estimates
    y_pred, y_std = model.predict(X, return_std=True)

    # Use prediction uncertainty to filter outliers
    uncertainty_threshold = 2.0  # Accept if prediction ± 2σ includes actual RT
```

**Advantages**:
- ✅ Better theoretical foundation for small samples
- ✅ Provides uncertainty estimates
- ✅ Automatic regularization through priors
- ✅ Less prone to overfitting

**Disadvantages**:
- ⚠️ More complex than Ridge regression
- ⚠️ Still struggles with n=3 (fundamental limitation)
- ⚠️ Validation R² may still be low
- ⚠️ Requires interpretation of uncertainty

**Expected Accuracy**: 5-10% improvement (marginal gain for n=3)

---

### Option E: Hybrid Multi-Level Strategy (BEST ⭐⭐⭐)

**Strategy**: Combine multiple approaches in a decision tree:

```
For each prefix group:
├─ n ≥ 10? → Use prefix-specific Ridge regression
│             validation R² ≥ 0.75? → ACCEPT
│             else → Fallback
├─ n ≥ 4? → Use prefix-specific Ridge regression
│            validation R² ≥ 0.70? → ACCEPT
│            else → Try family pooling → Fallback
├─ n = 3? → Try family pooling first
│           If pooled n ≥ 10 & validation R² ≥ 0.70 → ACCEPT family model
│           else → Fallback to overall regression
└─ n < 3? → Fallback to overall regression
           If overall validation R² < 0.50 → REJECT as insufficient anchors
```

**Implementation**:
```python
def _apply_rule1_hybrid(self, df):
    # Phase 1: Try prefix-specific regression
    for prefix in prefixes:
        n = len(anchor_compounds)

        if n >= 10:
            # Strong confidence in prefix-specific
            if self._validate_prefix_model(prefix, threshold=0.75):
                apply_prefix_model(prefix)
                continue

        elif n >= 4:
            # Moderate confidence in prefix-specific
            if self._validate_prefix_model(prefix, threshold=0.70):
                apply_prefix_model(prefix)
                continue

        # Failed prefix-specific or n=3 → try pooling
        family = self._find_prefix_family(prefix)
        if family and self._validate_family_model(family, threshold=0.70):
            apply_family_model(prefix, family)
            continue

        # Fallback to overall regression
        use_overall_regression(prefix)

    # Phase 2: Validate overall regression
    if overall_validation_r2 >= 0.50:
        return results
    else:
        # Even overall regression failed → insufficient data
        mark_compounds_as_unanalyzable()
```

**Advantages**:
- ✅ Uses best model at each level (prefix → family → overall)
- ✅ Maximizes accuracy while minimizing rejections
- ✅ Transparent decision logic
- ✅ Flexible for different datasets
- ✅ Combines strengths of all approaches

**Disadvantages**:
- ⚠️ Most complex implementation
- ⚠️ Requires family definitions
- ⚠️ More code to maintain

**Expected Accuracy**: 20-30% improvement (best overall)

## 🧪 Testing Strategy

### Test Case 1: n=3 Group Behavior
```python
# Isolate GD3 group (3 anchors)
gd3_data = df[df["prefix"] == "GD3"]

# Test fallback
results = processor.process_data(gd3_data, "porcine")

# Verify:
