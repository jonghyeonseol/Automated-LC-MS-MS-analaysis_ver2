## Risk Management

### Identified Risks

| Risk | Probability | Impact | Mitigation |
|------|------------|--------|------------|
| Redis installation issues | Low | Medium | Use Docker Redis, fallback to polling |
| Channels WebSocket complexity | Medium | Medium | Follow documented guide, use simple progress tracking |
| Celery configuration problems | Medium | High | Start with simple tasks, extensive testing |
| PostgreSQL migration data loss | Low | High | Thorough backup before migration, test restore |
| Production server issues | Medium | High | Deploy to staging first, rollback plan |
| Testing time overruns | High | Medium | Reduce coverage target to 70%, prioritize critical paths |
| Feature scope creep | High | Medium | Strict prioritization, defer non-critical features |

### Contingency Plans

**If Week 2 Falls Behind:**
- Skip PostgreSQL migration (continue with SQLite)
- Implement basic Celery without Channels
- Use simple polling instead of WebSocket

**If Week 3 Falls Behind:**
- Deploy to staging only (defer production)
- Reduce test coverage target to 70%
- Skip non-critical monitoring features

**If Week 4 Falls Behind:**
- Skip Dockerization (use traditional deployment)
- Implement only 1-2 additional features
- Defer CI/CD to post-launch
