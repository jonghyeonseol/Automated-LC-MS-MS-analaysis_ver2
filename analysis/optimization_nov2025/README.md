# Bayesian Ridge Optimization Archive (November 2025)

**Date**: October 31 - November 1, 2025
**Purpose**: Comprehensive optimization analysis leading to Bayesian Ridge migration
**Status**: âœ… Complete - Migration successful

---

## Overview

This archive contains all analysis scripts and reports from the optimization work that led to the successful migration from Ridge regression to Bayesian Ridge regression.

**Key Achievement**: +60.7% validation RÂ² improvement (0.386 â†’ 0.994)

---

## Contents

### Scripts (`scripts/`)

**Performance Analysis**:
1. `analyze_family_performance.py` - Family pooling performance analysis
   - Analyzed why GD_family RÂ²=0.518 (below threshold)
   - Found systematic RT offsets between prefixes
   - Confirmed current fallback strategy is correct

2. `compare_bayesian_ridge.py` - Ridge vs Bayesian Ridge comparison
   - Tested 6 prefix groups with LOOCV
   - Result: Bayesian wins 6/6 groups
   - Statistical significance: p=0.0312

**Optimization Studies**:
3. `optimize_thresholds.py` - Threshold optimization via grid search
   - Tested 317 threshold combinations
   - Confirmed current thresholds (0.75/0.70/0.70/0.50) are optimal

4. `test_feature_expansion.py` - Feature expansion analysis
   - Tested univariate vs multivariate regression
   - Confirmed Log P only is best for small samples

**Validation**:
5. `FINAL_VALIDATION.py` - Original validation test (Ridge)
6. `FINAL_VALIDATION_BAYESIAN.py` - New validation test (Bayesian Ridge)
   - Confirms 100% acceptance rate (+79.3% improvement)
   - Validates multi-level strategy effectiveness

7. `test_hybrid_standalone.py` - Hybrid multi-level strategy standalone test

## Key Findings

### 1. Family Model Performance
- **Issue**: GD_family pooling yields RÂ²=0.518 (below 0.70 threshold)
- **Cause**: Systematic RT offsets between prefixes (structural modifications alter RT)
- **Solution**: Current fallback to overall regression is correct

### 2. Bayesian Ridge vs Ridge
- **Average RÂ² Improvement**: 0.386 â†’ 0.994 (+60.7%)
- **n=3 Groups**: RÂ²=0.102 â†’ RÂ²=0.998 (automatic strong regularization)
- **False Positive Rate**: 67% â†’ 0%
- **Learned Alpha Values**:
  - n=23: Î± â‰ˆ 17 (weak regularization)
  - n=4: Î± â‰ˆ 109 (moderate)
  - n=3: Î± â‰ˆ 2,920-35,700 (very strong)

### 3. Threshold Optimization
- **Result**: Current thresholds already optimal
- **Score**: 0.999 (current) vs 0.999 (best found)
- **Recommendation**: No changes needed

### 4. Feature Expansion
- **Result**: Bayesian Ridge + Log P only = RÂ²=0.994
- **All Features**: RÂ²=0.989 (-0.004)
- **Recommendation**: Keep Log P only (simpler, best performance)
