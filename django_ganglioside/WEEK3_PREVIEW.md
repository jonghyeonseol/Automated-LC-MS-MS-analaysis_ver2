## Tools & Technologies

### Development

- black (code formatting)
- flake8 (linting)

### Deployment
- Ubuntu 22.04 LTS
- Nginx
- Gunicorn
- Systemd
- Let's Encrypt

### Monitoring
- Sentry (error tracking)
- Prometheus (metrics - optional)
- Grafana (dashboards - optional)
- Netdata (server monitoring)

### CI/CD
- GitHub Actions
- Docker Hub or GitHub Registry

---

## Risk Mitigation

### Potential Issues
1. **SSL certificate issues** - Use staging Let's Encrypt first
2. **WebSocket proxy problems** - Test Nginx WebSocket config
3. **Database migration fails** - Always backup before migration
4. **Performance degradation** - Load test before production
5. **Deployment downtime** - Use blue-green deployment

### Contingency Plans
- Keep development environment running
- Have rollback procedure ready
- Maintain database backups
- Document all configuration changes
- Test deployment on staging first
